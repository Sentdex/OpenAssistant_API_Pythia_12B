    "Welcome everyone to a bit of a showcasing and how-to with Open Assistant's Pythia 12 billion parameter model. This model is meant to be a chat assistant, like ChatGPT, but runnable locally. The model uses 48GB of memory, or 24GB at half precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is in live development and training, so you will want to keep an eye out for new releases. I started playing with this model's first variant (https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-1-pythia-12b) and the next time I checked for an update, there was a 4th iteration available (https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-4-pythia-12b-epoch-3.5). \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "At their most basic level, these large language GPT models just simply generate text sequentially. An example input might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"<|prompter|>What is a meme, and what's the history behind this word?<|endoftext|><|assistant|>\"\n",
